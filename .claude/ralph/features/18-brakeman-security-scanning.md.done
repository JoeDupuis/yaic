# Feature: Brakeman Security Scanning

## Description

Add Brakeman security scanning to the project CI pipeline. Brakeman is a static
analysis tool that checks Ruby code for security vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies

- 17-github-actions-ci (CI infrastructure must exist)

## Implementation

### 1. Install Brakeman

Add brakeman to the Gemfile:
```ruby
gem "brakeman"
```

### 2. Create wrapper script

Create `bin/brakeman` for easy invocation:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
bundle exec brakeman --force --no-pager "$@"
```

Note: `--force` is required because this is a gem, not a Rails app.

### 3. Add to CI

Add a security job to `.github/workflows/main.yml`:
```yaml
security:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  name: Security
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        persist-credentials: false
    - name: Set up Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: '3.4'
        bundler-cache: true
    - name: Run Brakeman
      run: bin/brakeman
```

### 4. Update QA agent

Add brakeman to the QA agent's validation commands and add a Security section
to the review checklist.

## Test Descriptions

No automated tests needed - Brakeman is run as part of CI.

## Notes

- Brakeman is designed for Rails apps but can scan any Ruby code with `--force`
- The scan should pass with no warnings for the current codebase
- Any new code that introduces security issues will fail the CI build
